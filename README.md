# Mastery

## Overview

Your goal on this project is to show what you can do.  There are no instructions. You are free to show your ability to do each competency however you would like to show it.  If you're unsure how to proceed I recommend building a simple e-commerce website or something similar.  By doing so you will pass off the majority of the items needed in this list.  

### Grading

In order to pass something off you will need to send information to your mentor and have them review it. The information they need is the name of the competency, the file(s) involved, and the line number(s) where the code is, so they can find it quickly.  The mentor reviewing your code will either pass you off on this competency or they will tell you what you need to improve to pass off the competency.
